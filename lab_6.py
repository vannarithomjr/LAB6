"""
To start, we will generate a random integer between 1 and 20.
Based on the result of the random number, we check to see if it falls under certain range.
If the number is grater than 15, then the result will be "Cherries".
Otherwise if the number is > 10, then the result will be "Orange".
Otherwise if the number is > 5, then the result will be "Plum".
Otherwise if the number is > 2, then the result will be "Melon".
Otherwise if the number is > 1, then the result will be "Bell".
If the number is not any of the above, then the result will be "Bar".
We iterate over using a loop thtee times and print the results to the user.
As an example, "Plum Cherries Melon"
